# React complete guide
This repository represents my progress of completing the Udemy course "React - The Complete Guide" (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).
It contains practise and quiz sections, so the learning process is not limited by repeating the instructor's code. 
Each commit name consists the current lecture I have completed.
